                <h3>App Usage:</h3>
                <p>Enter your long URL and click the button to get your URL Minified. Note that the user is required to enter the protocol - 'http://' or 'https://'.

                <h3>Assumptions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Expecting ~50 requests per second.</li>
                    <li>Average of 400 bytes per long URL.</li>
                    <li>Minimum of 10 years of operation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Implementation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client front end implemented with JavaScript/AngularJS as an SPA.</li>
                    <li>Application service back end implemented with Java/Servlets.</li>
                    <li>URLs are cached in memory using an ArrayList. This is a temporary solution due to time / cost constraints (see TODO list for future plans on this).</li>
                    <li>Encoding algorithm selected is Base32. This yields easy-human-readable output (see <a href="http://google.github.io/guava/releases/22.0-android/api/docs/" target="_blank">here</a>).</li>
                    <li>Safe Browsing: <a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/lookup-api" target="_blank">Google Safe Browsing Lookup API (v4)</a>
                    is used to test submitted URLs to verify they do not point to malicious web sites. The check is performed twice, on the <b>client</b> side:
                    (i) when the user submits the long URL for minification, and (ii) when the user attempts to navigate to the URL.
                    The initial check may be overcome by a malicious user (by performing a direct HTTP request [i.e., not via the Home page], or by generating a fresh
                    domain name unknown to the API). The second check by the end user will test the destination URL with the most up to date information.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Analysis:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requiring the user to input the protocol allows for future support of other protocols without the server making assumptions which protocol the
                    resource is to be requested with.</li>
                    <li>50 requests per second, 31536000 seconds per year, average of 400 bytes per long URL, minimum of 10 years, means a requirement for ~7 Terabytes storage at least.
                    This requires usage of a database on a distributed file system, such as Hadoop + HBase. HBase allows fast random lookup. Hosted on a Hadoop machine cluster with distributed file system
                    it will allow endless amount of storage. Concurrent access will be taken care of by the database. An encoded value of the DB table's row index (row index of the persisted long URL)
                    will serve as the resource portion of the minified URL. This will also obfuscate the minified URL by making it non-sequantial.</li>
                    <li>Performing Safe Browsing verifications on the client side saves processing resources of the server and uses up to date information available to Google. It may be that
                    this check takes somewhat more time to perform compared to usage of stale data by a fast server, but a user would appreciate knowing this check is performed with most up to date data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>TODO List:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace memory cache with persistant storage to <b>HBase on Hadoop</b> cluster.</li>
                    <li>Consider whether it is worth to check before persisting a long URL if it is already in DB. In that case, no need to re-insert. However, at this time, I believe such a check
                    on each and every insert is not justified for what I believe is more than likely only rare re-entry of identical long URLs.</li>
                    <li>After the Safe Browsing check, an <b>intentional delay</b> is added to the client side redirect to allow the end user a chance to read a note about this safety
                    feature. This is for demo only and shall be removed in production.</li>
                </ul>
